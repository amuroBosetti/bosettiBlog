<h1 align="center">
  Welcome to my blog!
</h1>

I made this website with **GatsbyJS**, using the [starter blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) as a base.

## Testing
To start the server, you need to clone it and navigate to the directory.
```
cd bosettiBlog/
gatsby develop
```
The site is now running at ``http://localhost:8000``. You can also test queries at ``http://localhost:8000/___.graphql``.

## Structure
GatsbyJS is a framework based on React which pulls data from different sources (in this case, my .md files). This files are located in the `/content` folder.
